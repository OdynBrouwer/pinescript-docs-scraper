## The Pine Editor
The Pine Editor is where you will be working on your scripts. While you can use any text editor you want to write your Pine scripts, using the Pine Editor has many advantages:
  * It highlights your code following Pine Script® syntax.
  * It pops up syntax reminders when you hover over language constructs.
  * It provides quick access to the Pine Script Reference Manual popup when you select `Ctrl` or `Cmd` and a built-in Pine Script construct, and opens the library publication page when doing the same with code imported from libraries.
  * It provides an auto-complete feature that you can activate by selecting `Ctrl`+`Space` or `Cmd`+`I`, depending on your operating system.
  * It makes the write/compile/run cycle more efficient because saving a new version of a script already loaded on the chart automatically compiles and executes it.


To open the Pine Editor, select the “Pine Editor” tab at the bottom of the TradingView chart.

## First version
Let’s create our first working Pine script, an implementation of the MACD indicator:
  1. Open the Pine Editor’s dropdown menu (the arrow at the top-left corner of the Pine Editor pane, beside the script name) and select “Create new/Indicator”.
  2. Copy the example script code below by clicking the button on the top-right of the code widget.
  3. Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the example code.
  4. Save the script by selecting the script name or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`S`. Choose a name for the script (e.g., “MACD #1”). The script is saved in TradingView’s cloud servers, and is local to your account, meaning only you can see and use this version.
  5. Select “Add to chart” in the Pine Editor’s menu bar. The MACD indicator appears in a _separate pane_ under the chart.


Pine Script®
Copied
`//@version=6  
indicator("MACD #1")  
fast = 12  
slow = 26  
fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)  
slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)  
macd = fastMA - slowMA  
signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)  
plot(macd, color = color.blue)  
plot(signal, color = color.orange)  
`
Our first Pine script is now running on the chart, which should look like this:
!image
Let’s look at our script’s code, line by line:
Line 1: `//@version=6`
compiler annotation telling the compiler the script uses version 6 of Pine Script.
Line 2: `indicator("MACD #1")`
Line 3: `fast = 12`
`fast` as the length of the fast moving average.
Line 4: `slow = 26`
`slow` as the length of the slow moving average.
Line 5: `fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)`
`fastMA`, which holds the result of the _EMA_ (Exponential Moving Average) calculated on the close series, i.e., the closing price of bars, with a length equal to `fast` (12).
Line 6: `slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)`
`slowMA`, which holds the result of the EMA calculated on the close series with a length equal to `slow` (26).
Line 7: `macd = fastMA - slowMA`
`macd` as the difference between the two EMAs.
Line 8: `signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)`
`signal` as a smoothed value of `macd` using the EMA algorithm with a length of 9.
Line 9: `plot(macd, color = color.blue)`
plot() function to output the variable `macd` using a blue line.
Line 10: `plot(signal, color = color.orange)`
plot() function to output the variable `signal` using an orange line.

## Second version
The first version of our script calculated the MACD using multiple steps, but because Pine Script is specially designed to write indicators and strategies, built-in functions exist for many common indicators, including one for MACD: ta.macd().
Therefore, we can write a second version of our script that takes advantage of Pine’s available built-in functions:
Pine Script®
Copied
`//@version=6  
indicator("MACD #2")  
fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")  
slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")  
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)  
plot(macdLine, color = color.blue)  
plot(signalLine, color = color.orange)  
`
Note that:
  * We add inputs so we can change the lengths of the moving averages from the script’s settings.
  * We now use the ta.macd() built-in function to calculate our MACD directly, which replaces three lines of calculations and makes our code easier to read.


Let’s repeat the same process as before to create our new indicator:
  1. Open the Pine Editor’s dropdown menu (the arrow at the top-left corner of the Pine Editor pane, beside the script name) and select “Create new/Indicator”.
  2. Copy the example script code above. The button on the top-right of the code widget allows you to copy it with a single click.
  3. Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the example code.
  4. Save the script by selecting the script name or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`S`. Choose a name for your script that is different from the previous one (e.g., “MACD #2”).
  5. Select “Add to chart” in the Pine Editor’s menu bar. The “MACD #2” indicator appears in a _separate pane_ under the “MACD #1” indicator.


Our second Pine script is now running on the chart. If we double-click on the indicator’s name on the chart, it displays the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab, where we can now change the fast and slow lengths used in the MACD calculation:
!image
Let’s look at the lines that have changed in the second version of our script:
Line 2: `indicator("MACD #2")`
`#1` to `#2` so the second version of our indicator displays a different name on the chart.
Line 3: `fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")`
input() function so we can change the length value from the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. The default value is `12` and the input field’s label is `"Fast length"`. When we change the value in the “Inputs” tab, the `fastInput` variable updates to contain the new length and the script re-executes on the chart with that new value. Note that, as our Pine Script Style guide recommends, we add `Input` to the end of the variable’s name to remind us, later in the script, that its value comes from a user input.
Line 4: `slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")`
`fastInput` in the previous line, we do the same for the slow length, taking care to use a different variable name, default value, and title string for the input field’s label.
Line 5: `[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)`
ta.macd() built-in function to perform all the first version’s calculations in only one line. The function requires four _parameters_ (the values enclosed in parentheses after the function name). It returns _three_ values, unlike the other functions we’ve used so far that only returned one. For this reason, we need to enclose the list of three variables receiving the function’s result in square brackets (to form a tuple) to the left of the `=` sign. Note that two of the values we pass to the function are the “input” variables containing the fast and slow lengths (`fastInput` and `slowInput`).
Lines 6 and 7: `plot(macdLine, color = color.blue)` and `plot(signalLine, color = color.orange)`
Our second version of the script performs the same calculations as our first, but we’ve made the indicator more efficient as it now leverages Pine’s built-in capabilities and easily supports variable lengths for the MACD calculation. Therefore, we have successfully improved our Pine script.
